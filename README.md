# Project Title

Call Analysis Project

## Description

We utilized [open datasets](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) from NYC OpenData and perfomed some analysis on the 311 phone number dataset. 

Our project includes two notebooks: Top10.ipynb and Parking.ipynb

In Top10.ipynb, we analyzed the top 10 caused of calls to 311 in our chosen zip code 10025 and sorted them in descending order 

In Parking.ipynb, we calculated the local parking incidents rate and compared that with the NYC parking incidents rate.
